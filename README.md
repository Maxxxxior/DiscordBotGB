# Info
In config.py you can change some of variables. And assign Role_id to variables `MODERATOR_ROLE_ID` and `SZEF_ROLE_ID`, both of those variables represent role on the server with administration permissions.

Language = Polish, English

Code may contain profanity. [mostly in polish tho (as a feature!)]

# Bugs:
- don't use "lewd neko pls" it loops program due website not working anymore probably.
